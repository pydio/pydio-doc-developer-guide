# Cells Internals

In this chapter, you will learn about the architecture of Pydio Cells. We consider it’s a good read for a better understanding of what you do and what you see (particularly in the logs). If you want to start interacting with Cells directly, you can jump to [the Cells APIs section](**TODO**: internal link to the corresponding section).
