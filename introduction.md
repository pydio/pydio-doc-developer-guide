### Introduction

[Pydio 8] This document is targetted as a broad audience: it will describe the most simple usages of the Pydio REST API, teach you how to write a simple Pydio plugin by following an example, and digg down to the internals of the Pydio code to put you quickly on track for hacking and contributing. 

As such, this reading is highly recommended if you want either to customize your installation or if you want to develop a full-featured plugin. You should be basically comfortable with XML and XPath syntaxes, as well as PHP if you want to add server-side functions, and JavaScript if you want to add client-side behaviours.
