### Introduction

This document is targetted to a broad audience: it describes the most simple usages of the Pydio REST API, teach you how to write a simple Pydio plugin by following an example, and dig down to the internals of the Pydio code to put you quickly on tracks for hacking and contributing.

As such, this reading is highly recommended if you want either to customize your installation or if you want to develop a full-featured plugin. You should be basically comfortable with Go language and Micro Service architecture if you want to add server-side functions, and JavaScript if you want to add client-side behaviours.
