## ./cells-enterprise

Secure File Sharing for business

### Synopsis

Thank you for using Pydio Cells.
Comprehensive sync & share solution for your collaborators. Open-source software deployed on-premise or in a private cloud.

### Installation

For the very first run, use './cells-enterprise install' to load browser-based or command-line based installation wizard. Services
will start at the end of the installation.

### Run

Run './cells-enterprise start' to load all services.

### Logs level

By default, logs are outputted in console format at the Info level. You can set the --log flag or set the PYDIO_LOGS_LEVEL environment
variable to one of the following values:
 - debug, info, error : logs are written in console format with the according level
 - production : logs are written in json format, for usage with a log aggregator tool.

### Services Discovery

Micro services need a registry mechanism to discover each other. You don't need to install any dependency.
Cells currently only supports NATS (nats.io) implementation. If a gnatsd service is already running, it will be detected.

### Cells working directories

By default, application data is stored under the standard OS application dir : 

 - Linux: ${USER_HOME}/.config/pydio/cells
 - Darwin: ${USER_HOME}/Library/Application Support/Pydio/cells
 - Windows: ${USER_HOME}/ApplicationData/Roaming/Pydio/cells

You can customize the various storage locations with the following ENV variables : 

 - CELLS_WORKING_DIR : replace the whole standard application dir
 - CELLS_DATA_DIR : replace the location for storing default datasources (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/data)
 - CELLS_LOG_DIR : replace the location for storing logs (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/logs)
 - CELLS_SERVICES_DIR : replace location for services-specific data (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/services)
