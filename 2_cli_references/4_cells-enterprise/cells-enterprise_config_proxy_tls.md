## ./cells-enterprise config proxy tls

Manage TLS configuration of the application internal proxy

### Synopsis


This command lets you enable/disabled TLS on the application main access point.

Four modes are currently supported:
- TLS mode : provide the paths to certificate and key (as you would on an apache server)
- Let's Encrypt: certificate is automagically generated during installation process, and later managed (e.g. renewed) by the embedded Caddy server
- Self-Signed : a self-signed certificate will be generated at each application start
- Disabled : application will be served on HTTP



```
./cells-enterprise config proxy tls [flags]
