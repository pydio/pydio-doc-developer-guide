## ./cells-enterprise admin jobs unlock-public

Unlock password-protected links that may have been blocked by wrong password

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to list 'hidden' users (that are automatically associated to public links) and unlock them if
  they are locked.

  This may be the result of password-protected links being brute-forced with wrong credentials attempts.
