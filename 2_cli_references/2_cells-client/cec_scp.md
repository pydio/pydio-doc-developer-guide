Copy files from/to Cells

### Synopsis


Copy files from your local machine to your Pydio Cells server instance (and vice versa).

To differentiate local from remote, prefix remote paths with 'cells://' or with 'cells//' (without the column) if you have installed the completion and intend to use it.
For the time being, copy can only be performed with both different ends.

Note that you can rename the file or base folder that you upload/download if:  

- last part of the target path is a new name that *does not exists*,  
- parent path exists and is a folder a target location.


```
./cec scp [flags]
```

### Examples

```

1/ Uploading a file to the server:
  $ ./cec scp ./README.md cells://common-files/
  Copying ./README.md to cells://common-files/
  Waiting for file to be indexed...
  File correctly indexed

2/ Download a file from server:
  $ ./cec scp cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg ./
  Copying cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg to /home/pydio/downloads/

3/ Download a file changing its name - remember: this will fail if a 'cat2.jpg' file already exists: 
  $ ./cec scp cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg ./cat2.jpg
  Copying cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg to /home/pydio/downloads/

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help    help for scp
  -q, --quiet   Reduce the amount of logs
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   Path to the configuration file
```
