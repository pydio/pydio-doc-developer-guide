## ./cec

Connect to a Cells Server using the command line

### Synopsis


# This tool uses the REST API to connect a Cells Server.

Pydio Cells comes with a powerful REST API that exposes various endpoints and enable management of a running Cells instance.
As a convenience, the Pydio team also provide a ready to use SDK for the Go language that encapsulates the boiling code to wire things 
and provides a few chosen utilitary methods to ease implemantation when using the SDK in various Go programs.

The children commands defined here show some basic examples of what can be achieved when combining the use of this SDK with 
the powerful Cobra framework to easily implement small CLI client applications.
