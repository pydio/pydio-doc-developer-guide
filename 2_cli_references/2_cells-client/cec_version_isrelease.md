Return an error if the passed version is a snapshot

### Synopsis

Tries to parse the passed string version using the hashicorp/go-version library 
and hence validates that it respects semantic versionning rules.

It then insures that the passed string is not a pre-release, 
that is that is not suffixed by "a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers 
immediately following the patch version", see: https://semver.org

In case the passed version is *not* a valid realease version, the process exits with status 1.

```
./cec version isrelease [flags]
```

### Examples

```

# A valid release version
./cec version isvalid 2.0.6

# A *non* release version
./cec version isvalid 2.0.6-dev.20191205

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for isrelease
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   Path to the configuration file
```
