Check if a given string represents a valid **RELEASE** version

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Check the passed string to validate that it respects semantic versioning rules
  *and* represents a valid release version.
  It returns an error if the string is not correctly formatted or represents a SNAPSHOT.
  
  Under the hood, we try to parse the version string using the hashicorp/go-version library.
  We then check that the passed string is not a pre-release, that is that is not suffixed 
  by "a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version", 
  see: https://semver.org
  
  In case the passed version is *not* a valid release version, the process prints an error 
  and exits with status 1. Otherwise it simply exits silently with status 0.

EXAMPLES

  A valid release version:
   ./cec version isvalid 2.0.6

  A *non* release version:
   ./cec version isvalid 2.0.6-dev.20191205


```
./cec version isrelease [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for isrelease
```
