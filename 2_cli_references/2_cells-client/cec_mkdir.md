Create folder(s) in the remote server

### Synopsis


mkdir commande creates a folder in the remote Cells server instance.
If ancestor folders do not exist and if the 'parents' flag is set, non-existing folders are recursively created. 

You must specify the full path, including the slug of an existing workspace: 
even if 'parents' flags is set, trying to create a folder in an unknown/unexisting workspace will result in an error.


```
./cec mkdir [flags]
```

### Examples

```

# Simply create a folder under an already existing folder 'existing' in 'common-files' workspace
./cec mkdir common-files/existing/new-folder

# Create a full tree
./cec mkdir -p common-files/a/folder/that/does/not/exits

```

### Options

```
  -h, --help      help for mkdir
  -p, --parents   Force creation of non-existing ancestors
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   Path to the configuration file
```
