Connect to the server directly using the Client Credentials

### Synopsis


Launch an interractive process to gather necessary client information to configure a connection to a running Pydio Cells server instance.

You can typically use the static credentials (Id and Secret) defined in the "services"."pydio.grpc.auth"."staticClients" section of your server's "pydio.json" config file, 
and a valid userName/password with enough permissions to achieve what you want on the server.

Please beware that this sentitive information will be stored in clear text if you do not have a **correctly configured and running** keyring on your client machine.

You can also go through the whole process in a non-interractive manner by using the provided flags.


```
./cec configure client-auth [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -k, --apiKey string      OIDC Client ID
  -s, --apiSecret string   OIDC Client Secret
  -h, --help               help for client-auth
  -l, --login string       User login
  -p, --password string    User password
      --skipVerify         Skip SSL certificate verification (not recommended)
  -u, --url string         HTTP URL to server
```
