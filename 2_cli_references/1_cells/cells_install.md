## ./cells install

Launch the installation process

### Synopsis


 This command launches the installation process of Pydio Cells.

 Be ready to answer a few questions to configure the network connection of your application:
   1. Bind URL: the name (or IP) and port to hook the internal webserver on a the network interface 
   2. TLS Settings: choose the TLS configuration that is exposed by this internal webserver
   3. External URL: the URL you communicate to your end-users. It can differ from your bind address, 
      typically if the app is behind a proxy or inside a container with ports mapping.

 You can also directly provide --bind and --external URLs. 
 This configures the internal proxy in self-signed mode and launches the browser-based installer. 
 If you are on the same machine, it opens a browser to gather necessary information and configuration for Pydio Cells, otherwise copy/paste the URL. 
 Services will all start automatically after the install process is finished.

 If you do not have a browser access, you can also perform the whole installation process using this CLI.

 See additional flags for more details or use another TLS mode, like in the following example that uses Let's Encrypt automatic certificate generation.

 $ ./cells install --bind share.mydomain.tld:443 --external https://share.mydomain.tld --le_email admin@mydomain.tld --le_agree true

 Here is a list with a few examples of valid URL couples:
 
 - Bind Host: 0.0.0.0:8080
 - External Host: https://share.mydomain.tld
 Or
 - Bind Host: share.mydomain.tld:443
 - External Host: https://share.mydomain.tld
 Or
 - Bind Host: IP:1515               # internal port
 - External Host: https://IP:8080   # external port mapped by docker
 Or
 - Bind Host: localhost:8080
 - External Host: http://localhost:8080  # Non-secured local installation

 

```
./cells install [flags]
```
