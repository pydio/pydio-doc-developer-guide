Filters and Queries modules are the components used to either filter a message content or dynamically load contents from Cells internals data to feed Actions inputs. 

As explained in the [Data Types](./data-types-queries-filters) section, these blocks are "typed" and use combination of criteria to build filtering or loading conditions. Below are describe the low-level blocks used for building conditions. When they are named "Selectors", it means that they can be used either in Filters or Queries components.
