This job allows automatic import of a CSV file containing users into Cells internal directory.

Interesting point here is that it takes a standard Cells file as input and listen for its changes (triggers on "Create Node" or "Update Content"). That way you just have to setup a specific 
location in a workspace accessed by administrator to upload an updated CSV and have it parsed and imported automatically.
