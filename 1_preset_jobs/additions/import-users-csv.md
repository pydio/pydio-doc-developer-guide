This job allows automatic import of a CSV file containing users into Cells internal directory.

Interesting point here is that it takes and standard Cells file as input and listen for its changes (triggers on "Create Node" or "Update Content"). That way you just have to setup a specific 
location in a workspace accessed by administrator to upload an updated CSV and have it parsed and imported automatically.
