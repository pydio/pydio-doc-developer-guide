This flow can be used to compute (or recompute) files hashes inside a specific folder. It was primarily introduced in version 4 to attach a new hash signature to files `x-cells-hash` metadata. This new algorithm (`Cells Internal`) was introduced to provide a consistent hashing through the whole application, whatever the upload method (direct PUT, Multipart), the encryption mechanism and the datasource storage.

The "Compute Hash" action can also be used to compute common hashes and attach them to any metadata. Supported algorithm are `md4`, `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`.
