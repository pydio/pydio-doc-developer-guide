This job demonstrates how to listen for all new files added to a specific folder (`upload`) and move them
automatically to another location (`download`). This can be handy if these two locations are inside two different 
workspaces whose accesses are restricted on a per-network access using Security Policies for specific compliance/regulatory rules.
