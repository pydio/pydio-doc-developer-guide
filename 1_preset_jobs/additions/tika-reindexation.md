Apache Tika is an independant, open source, content extractor that supports a very wide range of file formats. It can
even support OCR for extracting text from images. 

Although content extraction should be done on an event-based manner (at files upload or modification), this job can be useful
when enabling Tika on an existing system to crawl all files and index them at once.
