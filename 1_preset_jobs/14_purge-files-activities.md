Clear activities on files/folders based on criteria.

[:image:1_preset_jobs/capture-purge-files-activities.png]

This job is a preset version of the "Purge Activities" generic job, providing out-of-the-box parameters for regular pruning of files and folders activities.  It should be run on a regular basis to avoid growing the on-file activities database to a very large size.


### Parameters

|----|----|-------|---------|-----------|
|KeepAtLeast|integer|1|false|Keep at least N activities on each file/folder.|
|KeepMax|integer|10|false|Maximum number of activities to be kept on each file/folder.|
