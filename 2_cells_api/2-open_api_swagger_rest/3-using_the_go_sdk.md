We also provide and maintain a Go SDK that provides a convenient way to implement Go clients for Pydio Cells.
The SDK is generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project from the swagger json file that can be found in `cells/common/proto/rest/rest.swagger.json`.

For the record, we use two “tricks” in the SDK generation process:

* we use the --skip-validation flag to avoid circular issues with object that make reference to same type of objects, typically activities and jobs. See [issue #957 in go-swagger repository](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/957) for more details._
* we apply a patch that change all the default json tag that are generated for all field with type `int64` to workaround the int64 serialisation issue between protobuf and swagger

For your convenience, we have implemented a bunch of basic examples that use the SDK to perform simple action on a running Pydio Cells instance.
