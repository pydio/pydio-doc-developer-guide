In this section, we provide some real-life examples for making API calls to Cells using standard tools. Examples will go through the necessary authentication step, some basic calls to the Rest API, and the usage of the S3 API.

[Curl](https://curl.se/docs) is typically helpful when you are diagnosing a buggy setup from the command line.

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/api-documentation-tool) can be use to better understand the various API requests.

If you want to directly talk to your Cells Server Instance from the command line, typically to perform cron jobs or in your CICD pipe, you most probably want to rather user the [Cells Client](./cells-client), otherwise we also provide [already packaged SDKs](./clients-sdks)
