### API Specification

All Cells RestAPI are documented in the OpenAPI JSON Document format. This de-facto standard can be used to generate documentations, but also client SDK or stub servers in a very wide number of programming languages. The next chapter Cells API is actually auto-generated by the application.

The Rest endpoints are available using HTTP/1.1 protocol at [https://yourcells.tld/a/](https://yourcells.tld/a/), and protected using the OAuth2 protocol (see below).
