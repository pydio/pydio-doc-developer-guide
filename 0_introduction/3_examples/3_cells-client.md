### Authentication

As with other API consumers, you first need to authenticate against the server. This is done by using the following command:

```sh
cec configure oauth
```

If you are on a desktop-based computer, a browser is opened on your server login page. After successful login, the server calls back the Cells Client with an authorization code. `cec` uses this to retrieve an ID and a refresh token that is saved in your local key chain. The ID token is automatically refreshed thanks to the refresh token when necessary.

If the `cec` is installed on a headless server, you can go through the process with a couple of copy/paste: just follow the instructions displayed by the `configure`command.

_You can also authenticate your client with a Personal Access Token generated by an admin on the server side. This is typically useful for background jobs (for instance CRON jobs)_.

### Usage

As documented in the [Command Line references](./cells-client-cec), cec provides the following commands :

```sh
Available Commands:
  clear       Clear current configuration
  completion  Add auto-completion helper to Cells Client
  configure   Configure a connection to a running server and locally persist credentials for later use
  cp          Copy files from A to B within your remote server
  doc         Generate documentation of the Cells Client
  help        Help about any command
  idm         Identity Management commands
  ls          List files in your remote server
  mkdir       Create folder(s) in the remote server
  mv          Move and/or rename nodes on the server
  rm          Trash files or folders
  scp         Copy files from/to Cells
  storage     DataSources management commands
  update      Check for available updates and apply them
  version     Show Cells Client version information
```

### Examples

Using the `cec scp` command, you can easily upload or download files to/from the Cells server. Its usage is similar to the terminal `scp` command, except that the Cells path must be identified by a `cells//` prefix. Which gives for example:

**Upload to server**:

```sh
./cec scp path/to/local/file cells//path/to/remote/file
```

**Download from server**:

```sh
./cec scp cells//path/to/remote/file path/to/local/file
```
