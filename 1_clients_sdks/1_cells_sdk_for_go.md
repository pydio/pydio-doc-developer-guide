We provide and maintain a Go SDK that provides a convenient way to implement Go clients for Pydio Cells. It is hosted on Github at [https://github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go](https://github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go).

The repository also contains a bunch of basic examples that use the SDK to perform simple actions on a running Pydio Cells server instance.

#### Generation

The SDK is generated by the [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) project. For the record, we use two “tricks” during the SDK generation process:

- Use `--skip-validation` flag to avoid circular issues with object that make reference to same type of objects, typically activities and jobs. See [issue #957 in go-swagger repository](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/957) for more details.
- Patch all default json tags that are generated for all fields with type `int64` to workaround the int64 serialisation issue between protobuf and swagger.
