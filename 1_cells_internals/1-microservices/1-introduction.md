Pydio Cells is composed of a set of “microservices”, each one being dedicated to a simple task. These services can run distributed on a cluster of servers, and most of them can be independently horizontally scaled. They all communicate together via specific APIs, and each service brings its own persistence layer (when necessary).
That way, breaking a monolithic application into a set of microservices introduces many improvements:

- Communication between services via API dictates a predefined protocol without assuming the nature of the service. Services can for example be written in different languages.
- Per-service persistence layer allows to choose the best persistence implementation for the task implemented by each service.
- When the application is under heavy load, it is possible to scale only the specific services that constitute bottlenecks, other than scaling out the whole application.
- Apart the request/response model, a generic event bus can broadcast messages to any service that has subscribed for a given topic, allowing asynchronous communication and event-triggered actions.

Pydio tries to follow at most the [12-factors architecture pattern](https://12factor.net) that constitutes best practices for microservices.
