The code is currently using 3 branches (not counting the temporary dev branches) : 
master : upstream branch, use this as default for Pull Requests

* stable : the last stable version released
* x :  (experimental) contains features that are already advanced but still considered unstable.

Pull requests must comply with the main Guidelines (described above). They must come with dedicated passing tests. It can take some time to review and accept them, please be patient, and eventually update them regularly if the master branch is changing.
