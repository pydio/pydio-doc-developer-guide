## Reporting bugs 

As described in the main contribution rules, we use Github only for "qualified bugs" : bugs that are easily reproduced and validated by a Pydio Team member. Our preferred communication channel is our Forum. Please do not ask question in github issues, nor in Twitter or other social feed.
So, what should I do in case of:

* Install or upgrade issue? Search the F.A.Q or READ THE DOCS
* No answer yet? Search the FORUM
* Still stuck? It's time to ask the community via the FORUM

And only if you're invited to

* Post a github issue: make sure to put as much detail as possible (see below).
* or submit a pull request.
