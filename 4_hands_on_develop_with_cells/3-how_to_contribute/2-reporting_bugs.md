As described in the main contribution rules, we use Github only for "qualified bugs" : bugs that are easily reproduced and validated by a Pydio Team member. Our preferred communication channel is our Forum. Please do not ask question in github issues, nor in Twitter or other social feed.

So, what should I do in case of:

- Install or upgrade issue? Search the [F.A.Q](https://pydio.com/en/docs/faq) or [READ THE DOCS](https://pydio.com/en/docs)
- No answer yet? Search the [FORUM](https://wopi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Still stuck? It's time to ask the community via the [FORUM](https://wopi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

And only if you're invited to:

- Post a github issue: make sure to put as much detail as possible.
- or submit a pull request.
