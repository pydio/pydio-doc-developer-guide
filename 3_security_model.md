Pydio Cells provides two complementary approaches to manage authorizations:

- role-based permissions are inherited from Pydio 8
- resource-based security rules provide additional flexibility to define access based on a set of conditions.

Also, Pydio Cells provides out-of-the-box an encryption feature in order to encrypt data at rest.
