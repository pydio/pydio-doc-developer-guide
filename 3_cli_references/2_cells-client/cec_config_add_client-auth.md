Connect to the server using Client Credentials

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Configure your Cells Client to connect to your distant server using Client Credentials.
  Note that this procedure is less secure than the other ones (using OAuth2 or a Personal Access Token).

  Please also beware that the password will be stored in clear text if you do not have a **correctly configured and running** keyring on your client machine.

USAGE

  This command launches an interactive process that gather necessary information to configure your connection to a running Cells server.
  You must provide a valid login and password for a user with enough permissions to achieve what you want on the server.

  You can also go through the whole process in a non-interactive manner by using the provided flags.


```
./cec config add client-auth [flags]
