Compare the two versions, succeed when the first is greater than the second

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Check the passed strings to validate that they respects semantic versioning rules
  and then compare them.
  
  Under the hood, it tries to parse the version strings using the hashicorp/go-version library
  and then compare the 2 resulting version structs.
  
  The command prints an error and exits with status 1 if:
    - one of the 2 strings is not a valid semantic version,
    - the first version is not strictly greater than the second.

  Otherwise, the command simply exits with status 0.	

  If the "quiet" mode is enabled, the command simply returns 1 (true) or 0 (false), depending
  on the passed arguments, without writing to error out.

EXAMPLE

  This exits with status 1:
   ./cec version isgreater 2.0.6-dev.20191205 2.0.6

  This returns 0 - false (and exits with status 0):
   ./cec version isgreater --quiet 4.0.5-rc2 4.0.5



```
./cec version isgreater [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help    help for isgreater
  -q, --quiet   Simply returns 1 (true) or 0 (false) if first passed version is greater than the second, without writing to standard error stream
```
