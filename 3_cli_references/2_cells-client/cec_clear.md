### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

```
./cec clear [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help         help for clear
      --no-keyring   Explicitly tell the tool to *NOT* try to use a keyring. Only use this flag if you really know what your are doing: some sensitive information will end up stored on your file system in clear text.
```
