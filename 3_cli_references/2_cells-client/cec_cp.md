Copy files from A to B within your remote server

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Copy files from one location to another *within* a *single* Pydio Cells instance. 
  To copy files from the client machine to your server (and vice versa), rather see the './cec scp' command.

WILD-CHARS

  Since version 2, we only support the '*' wild char as a standalone token of the source path, that is:
    - './cec cp common-files/test/* common-files/target' is legit and will copy 
	  all files and folder found in test folder on your server to the target folder
	- './cec cp common-files/test/*.jpg ...' or './cec cp common-files/test/ima* ...'  
	  will *not* work as some might expect: the system looks for a single file named respectively '*.jpg' or 'ima*'
	  and will probably fail to find it (unless if a file with this name exists on your server...)

EXAMPLE

  # Copy file "test.txt" from workspace root inside target "folder-a":
  ./cec cp common-files/test.txt common-files/folder-a

  # Copy a file from a workspace to another:
  ./cec cp common-files/test.txt personal-files/folder-b

  # Copy the full content of a folder inside another
  ./cec cp common-files/test/* common-files/folder-c


```
./cec cp [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for cp
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string     Location of Cells Client's config files, usually /home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells-client
      --login string      The user login, for Client auth only
      --no_cache          Force token refresh at each call. This might slow down scripts with many calls
      --password string   The user password, for Client auth only
      --skip_keyring      Explicitly tell the tool to *NOT* try to use a keyring, even if present. Warning: sensitive information will be stored in clear text
      --skip_verify       By default the Cells Client verifies the validity of TLS certificates for each communication. This option skips TLS certificate verification
  -t, --token string      A valid Personal Access Token (PAT)
  -u, --url string        The full URL of the target server
```
