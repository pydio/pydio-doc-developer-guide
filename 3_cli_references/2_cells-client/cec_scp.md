Copy files from/to Cells

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Copy files from the client machine to your Pydio Cells server instance (and vice versa).

  To differentiate local from remote, prefix remote paths with 'cells://' or with 'cells//' (without the column) if you have installed the completion and intend to use it.
  For the time being, copy can only be performed from the client machine to the server or the otherway round:
  it is not yet possible to copy from one Cells instance to another.

SYNTAX

  Note that you can rename the file or base folder that you upload/download if:  
   - last part of the target path is a new name that *does not exists*,  
   - parent path exists and is a folder at target location.

EXAMPLES

  1/ Uploading a file to the server:
  $ ./cec scp ./README.md cells://common-files/
  Copying ./README.md to cells://common-files/
  Waiting for file to be indexed...
  File correctly indexed

  2/ Download a file from server:
  $ ./cec scp cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg ./
  Copying cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg to /home/pydio/downloads/

  3/ Download a file changing its name - remember: this will fail if a 'cat2.jpg' file already exists: 
  $ ./cec scp cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg ./cat2.jpg
  Copying cells://personal-files/funnyCat.jpg to /home/pydio/downloads/	


```
./cec scp [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help    help for scp
  -q, --quiet   Reduce the amount of logs
```

      --login string      The user login, for Client auth only
