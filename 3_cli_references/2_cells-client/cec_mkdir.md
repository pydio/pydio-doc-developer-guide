Create folder(s) in the remote server

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Create a folder in the remote Cells server instance. 
  You must specify the full path, including the slug of an existing workspace.
  
  If parent folder does not exists, the command fails unless the '-p' flag is set.
  In such a case, non-existing folders are recursively created. 
  
  Warning: even if '-p' flag is set, trying to create a folder in an unknown or non-existent 
  workspace fails with error.

EXAMPLES

  # Simply create a folder under an already existing folder 'test' in 'common-files' workspace
  ./cec mkdir common-files/test/new-folder

  # Create a full tree
  ./cec mkdir -p common-files/a/folder/that/does/not/exits


```
./cec mkdir [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help      help for mkdir
  -p, --parents   Force creation of non-existing ancestors
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string     Location of Cells Client's config files (default "/home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells-client")
      --login string      The user login, for Client auth only
      --no_cache          Force token refresh at each call. This might slow down scripts with many calls
      --password string   The user password, for Client auth only
      --skip_keyring      Explicitly tell the tool to *NOT* try to use a keyring, even if present. Warning: sensitive information will be stored in clear text
      --skip_verify       By default the Cells Client verifies the validity of TLS certificates for each communication. This option skips TLS certificate verification
  -t, --token string      A valid Personal Access Token
  -u, --url string        The full URL of the target server
```
