Trash files or folders

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION
	
  Delete specified files or folders. 
	
  In fact, it only moves specified files or folders to the recycle bin 
  that is at the root of the corresponding workspace, the trashed objects 
  can be restored (from the web UI, this feature is not yet implemented 
  in the Cells Client) 

EXAMPLES

  # Generic example:
  ./cec rm <workspace-slug>/path/to/resource

  # Remove a single file:
  ./cec rm common-files/target.txt

  # Remove recursively inside a folder, the wildcard is '%':
  ./cec rm common-files/folder/%

  # Remove a folder and all its children (even if it is not empty)
  ./cec rm common-files/folder

  # Remove multiple files
  ./cec rm common-files/file-1.txt common-files/file-2.txt

  # You can force the deletion with the '--force' flag (to avoid the Yes or No)
  ./cec rm -f common-files/file-1.txt


```
./cec rm [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --force   Do not ask for user approval
  -h, --help    help for rm
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string     Location of Cells Client's config files, usually /home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells-client
      --login string      The user login, for Client auth only
      --no_cache          Force token refresh at each call. This might slow down scripts with many calls
      --password string   The user password, for Client auth only
      --skip_keyring      Explicitly tell the tool to *NOT* try to use a keyring, even if present. Warning: sensitive information will be stored in clear text
      --skip_verify       By default the Cells Client verifies the validity of TLS certificates for each communication. This option skips TLS certificate verification
  -t, --token string      A valid Personal Access Token (PAT)
  -u, --url string        The full URL of the target server
