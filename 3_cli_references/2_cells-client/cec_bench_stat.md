Perform a set of stats calls in concurrency

### Synopsis

This command creates a simple resource (a folder) and then sends tons of stats on this resource in parallel.

```
./cec bench stat [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for stat
  -r, --resource string   Folder created that will be stated (default "common-files/test-bench-dir")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string     Location of Cells Client's config files (default "/home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells-client")
      --login string      The user login, for Client auth only
  -m, --max int           Total number of Stat requests sent (default 100)
      --no_cache          Force token refresh at each call. This might slow down scripts with many calls
      --no_clean          Skip cleaning the resources that have been created for this test
  -n, --no_create         Skip test resource creation (if it is already existing)

      --skip_keyring      Explicitly tell the tool to *NOT* try to use a keyring, even if present. Warning: sensitive information will be stored in clear text
      --skip_verify       By default the Cells Client verifies the validity of TLS certificates for each communication. This option skips TLS certificate verification
      --timeout int       Timeout for HTTP requests (in minutes) (default 2)
  -t, --token string      A valid Personal Access Token
  -u, --url string        The full URL of the target server
