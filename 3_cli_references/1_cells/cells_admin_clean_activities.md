Purge user or file activities based on various criteria

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to purge activities. The server must be running when launching this command.

  Activities are "social" events displayed in the interface. They can be either attached to "users" (notifications feed)
  or "nodes" (files/folders activities shown in the right panel when selecting a node).

  As they can grow indefinitely, this command can help for housekeeping and maintaining the activities database small.

EXAMPLES

  Purge users notifications, keeping at least 5 and maximum 20 items per user: 

  $ ./cells admin clean activities --type users --box inbox -a admin --min 5 --max 20



```
./cells admin clean activities [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --admin string     Provide login of the administrator user
  -b, --box string       Either inbox (notifications received) or outbox (user activity / file activity) (default "outbox")
      --clear            After DB compaction, remove original file, otherwise keep it as a backup
      --compact          Trigger DB compaction by copying boltDB into a new file (default true)
      --db string        Point directly to a DB file to perform the purge offline
  -h, --help             help for activities
      --max int          Clear by keeping a maximum number of records inside each box
      --min int          Keep at least N, 0 for clearing all records (default 1)
  -o, --owner string     Specific user or node ID, or all (default "*")
      --timeout string   Set a longer timeout if there are tons of activities to purge (duration) (default "6h")
  -t, --type string      Activity type, one of 'nodes' or 'users' (default "nodes")
      --updated string   Clear by keeping all records updated before a given date. Use golang duration, e.g. '3d' will keep all records updated in the last 3 days and remove older entries.
