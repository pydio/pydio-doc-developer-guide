Generate a personal token for a user

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Generate a personal authentication token for a user. 
  Expiration can be set in two ways:  
    + A hard limit, by using the -e flag (duration)
    + A sliding window by using the -a flag (duration): in that case the token expiration will be refreshed each time
      the token is used (e.g a request using this token is received).

EXAMPLES

  Generate a token that lasts 24 hours for user admin
  $ ./cells admin user token -u admin -e 24h

  Generate a token that lasts by default 10mn, but which expiration is refreshed to the next 10mn each time 
  the token is used.
  $ ./cells admin user token -u admin -a 10m

TOKEN USAGE

  These token can be used in replacement of an OAuth2-based access token: they can replace the "Bearer" access 
  token when calling any REST API. They can also be used as the password (in conjunction with username) for all 
  basic-auth based APIs (e.g. webDAV).

TOKEN SCOPE

  By default, generated tokens grant the same level of access as a standard login operation. To improve security, 
  it is possible to restrict these accesses to a specific file or folder (given it is accessible by the user in 
  first place) with a "scope" in the format "node:NODE_UUID:PERMISSION" where PERMISSION string contains either "r"
  (read) or "w" (write) or both.


```
./cells admin user token [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --auto string     Auto-refresh expiration when token is used. Format is 20u where u is a unit: s (second), (minute), h (hour), d(day).
  -e, --expire string   Expire after duration. Format is 20u where u is a unit: s (second), (minute), h (hour), d(day).
  -h, --help            help for token
  -q, --quiet           Only return the newly created token value (typically useful in automation scripts with a short expiry time)
  -s, --scope strings   Optional scopes
  -u, --user string     User login (mandatory)
```
