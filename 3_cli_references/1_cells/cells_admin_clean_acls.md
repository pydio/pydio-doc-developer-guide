Clean Expired ACLs

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  When deleted after a node deletion, ACLs are not really deleted but only expired, to be able to restore them
  if necessary. This can lead to keep unused data, and particularly shared links information that may prevent users to 
  re-use an existing custom link value. Use this command to definitely delete expired ACLs based on a period. 

  Parameters accept either timestamps or durations. In the later case, corresponding time is computed using "Now - Duration".

EXAMPLES

  Clean all ACLs expired before last 24h 

  $ ./cells clean admin acls --before 24h 



```
./cells admin clean acls [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --after string    Expiration date is greater than...
  -b, --before string   Expiration date is lower than... (default "240h")
  -h, --help            help for acls
```
