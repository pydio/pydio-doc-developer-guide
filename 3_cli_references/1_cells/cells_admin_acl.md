Manage access control lists

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  ACLs are managed in a dedicated microservice.

  It is simpler to manage them in the frontend, but you can use this command to create/delete/search ACLs directly.
  ACLs are used to grant permissions to a given node (retrieved by UUID) for a given Role.


```
./cells admin acl [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for acl
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --broker string       Pub/sub service for events between services (default "grpc://:8001")
      --config string       config file (default is $HOME/.test.yaml)
      --port_broker int     Port used to start a broker discovery service (default 8003)
