## ./cells admin acl

Manage access control lists

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  ACLs are managed in a dedicated microservice.

  It is simpler to manage them in the frontend, but you can use this command to create/delete/search ACLs directly.
  ACLs are used to grant permissions to a given node Uuid for a given Role.


```
./cells admin acl [flags]
```

  -h, --help   help for acl
```
