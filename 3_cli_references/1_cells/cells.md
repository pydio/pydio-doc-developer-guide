## ./cells

Secure File Sharing for business

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Cells is a comprehensive sync & share solution for your collaborators. 
  Open-source software deployed on-premise or in a private cloud.

CONFIGURE

  For the very first run, use './cells configure' to begin the browser-based or command-line based installation wizard. 
  Services will automatically start at the end of a browser-based installation.

RUN

  Run '$ ./cells start' to load all services.

WORKING DIRECTORIES

  By default, application data is stored under the standard OS application dir : 
  
   - Linux: ${USER_HOME}/.config/pydio/cells
   - Darwin: ${USER_HOME}/Library/Application Support/Pydio/cells
   - Windows: ${USER_HOME}/ApplicationData/Roaming/Pydio/cells

  You can customize the storage locations with the following ENV variables : 
  
   - CELLS_WORKING_DIR: replace the whole standard application dir
   - CELLS_DATA_DIR: replace the location for storing default datasources (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/data)
   - CELLS_LOG_DIR: replace the location for storing logs (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/logs)
   - CELLS_SERVICES_DIR: replace location for services-specific data (default CELLS_WORKING_DIR/services) 

LOGS LEVEL

  By default, logs are outputted in console format at the Info level. You can set the --log flag or set the 
  CELLS_LOGS_LEVEL environment variable to one of the following values:
   - debug, info, error: logs are written in console format with the according level
   - production: logs are written in json format, to be used with a log aggregator tool.

SERVICES DISCOVERY

  Microservices use NATS as a registry mechanism to discover each other. Cells ships and starts its own NATS (nats.io) 
  implementation, unless a nats server is already running on the standard port, in which case it will be detected.
