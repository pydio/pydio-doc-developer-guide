Generate the autocompletion script for bash

### Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.

This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your OS's package manager.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	source <(./cells-enterprise completion bash)

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

#### Linux:

	./cells-enterprise completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/./cells-enterprise

#### macOS:

	./cells-enterprise completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/./cells-enterprise

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
./cells-enterprise completion bash
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    Configuration URL (default "file:///home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells/pydio.json")
      --keyring string   Keyring URL (default "file:///home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells/cells-vault-key?keyring=true")
      --vault string     Vault URL (default "detect")
```
