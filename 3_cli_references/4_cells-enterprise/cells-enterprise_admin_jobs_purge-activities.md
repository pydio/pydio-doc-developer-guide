## ./cells-enterprise admin jobs purge-activities

Purge users or files activities based on various criteria

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to purge activities. The server must be running when launching this command.

  Activities are "social" events displayed in the interface. They can be either attached to "users" (notifications feed)
  or "nodes" (files/folders activities shown in the right panel when selecting a node).

  As they can grow indefinitely, this command can help for housekeeping and maintaining the activities database small.
