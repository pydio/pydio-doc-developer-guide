## ./cells-enterprise configure sites

Manage site addresses

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION
  
  Manage how Cells is binding to the local host's network interfaces addresses and accepting traffic coming from external URLs.
  This is the main tool for listing, editing, adding and removing sites. Additional sub-commands allow you to directly create/delete sites.
  
  Each site has following parameters:
   1. <Bind Addresse(s)>: one or more <ip/hostname:port> to bind Cells to local host's network interfaces addresses. 
   2. <TLS Settings>: TLS configuration for HTTPS support.
   3. <External URL>: Accept traffic coming from this url and redirect to one of the bind address.
      Typically if the app is behind a reverse-proxy or inside a container with ports mapping.
   4. <Maintenance Mode> [On|Off]: expose a maintenance page on this endpoint, although Cells is running.

EXAMPLES 

  1. Default value (used when no sites is configured)
    - Bind Address: 0.0.0.0:8080
