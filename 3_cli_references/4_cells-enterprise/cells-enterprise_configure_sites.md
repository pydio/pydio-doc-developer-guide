Manage site addresses

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION
  
  Manage how Cells is binding to the localhost's network interface addresses and accepting traffic coming from external URLs.
  This is the main tool for listing, editing, adding and removing sites. Additional sub-commands allow you to directly create or delete sites.
  
  Each site has following parameters:
   1. <Bind Addresse(s)>: one or more <ip/hostname:port> to bind Cells to localhost's network interface addresses. 
   2. <TLS Settings>: TLS configuration for HTTPS support.
   3. <External URL>: Accept traffic coming from this url and redirect to one of the bind address.
      Typically if the app is behind a reverse proxy or inside a container with ports mapping.
   4. <Maintenance Mode> [On|Off]: expose a maintenance page on this endpoint, although Cells is running.

EXAMPLES 

  1. Default value (used when no sites is configured)
    - Bind Address: 0.0.0.0:8080
    - TLS: SelfSigned
    - External URL: [left empty]
  
  2. Provided certificate
    - Bind Address: 0.0.0.0:8080
    - TLS: Your own key/cert pair
    - External URL: https://share.mydomain.tld
  
  3. Auto-TLS using Let's Encrypt 
    - Bind Address: share.mydomain.tld:443
    - TLS: LetsEncrypt
    - External URL: https://share.mydomain.tld
  
  4. Self-signed
    - Bind Address: IP:1515         # internal port
    - TLS: Self-signed
    - External URL: https://IP:8080   # external port mapped by docker
  
  5. HTTP only
    - Bind Address: localhost:8080
    - TLS: Disabled
