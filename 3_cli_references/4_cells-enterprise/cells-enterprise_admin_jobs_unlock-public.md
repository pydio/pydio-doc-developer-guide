Unlock password-protected links that may have been blocked by wrong password

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to list 'hidden' users (that are automatically associated to public links) and unlock them if
  they are locked.

  This may be the result of password-protected links being brute-forced with wrong credentials attempts.



```
./cells-enterprise admin jobs unlock-public [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --admin_user string   Administrative user login for running job in scheduler
  -h, --help                help for unlock-public
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --broker string      Pub/sub service for events between services (default "grpc://:8002")
      --config string      config file (default is $HOME/.test.yaml) (default "file:///home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells")
      --discovery string   Registry and pub/sub (default "grpc://:8002")
