Unlock password-protected links that may have been blocked by wrong password

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to list 'hidden' users (that are automatically associated to public links) and unlock them if
  they are locked.

  This may be the result of password-protected links being brute-forced with wrong credentials attempts.

./cells-enterprise admin jobs unlock-public [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --admin_user string   Administrative user login for running job in scheduler

```
