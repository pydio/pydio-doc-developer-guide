Unlock password-protected links that may have been blocked by wrong password

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  Launch a dedicated job to list 'hidden' users (that are automatically associated to public links) and unlock them if
  they are locked.

  This may be the result of password-protected links being brute-forced with wrong credentials attempts.



```
./cells-enterprise admin jobs unlock-public [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -a, --admin_user string   Administrative user login for running job in scheduler
  -h, --help                help for unlock-public
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --broker string      Pub/sub service for events between services (default "grpc://:8002")
      --config string      Configuration storage URL. Supported schemes: etcd|file|grpc|mem|vault (default "file:///home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells/pydio.json")
      --discovery string   Registry and pub/sub (default "grpc://:8002")
      --registry string    Registry used to contact services (default "grpc://:8002")
      --vault string       Vault location, automatically detected from config url, unless an URL is provided (same schemes as config) (default "detect")
```
