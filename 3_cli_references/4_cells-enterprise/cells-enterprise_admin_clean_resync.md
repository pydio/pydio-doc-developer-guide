And a TriggerResync gRPC command to a service

### Synopsis


DESCRIPTION

  TriggerResync is a generic gRPC endpoint that can be implemented by various services to perform internal
  clean-up or resynchronization.

  This can be currently used for datasources (see 'admin datasource' commands), search engine, logs (for truncating).
  The "path" can be used by some services to read additional parameters.

EXAMPLES

  To trigger the re-indexation of "pydiods1" datasource, target the "sync" service associated to the datasource : 

  1. Equivalent to "admin datasource resync" command:
  $ ./cells-enterprise clean admin resync --service=pydio.grpc.data.sync.pydiods1 

  2. Re-index search engine:
  $ ./cells-enterprise clean admin resync -s pydio.grpc.search

  3. Truncate logs to a given size (in bytes):
  $ ./cells-enterprise clean admin resync --service=pydio.grpc.logs --path=TRUNCATE/200000


```
./cells-enterprise admin clean resync [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help             help for resync
  -p, --path string      Can be used by some services to read additional parameters (default "/")
  -s, --service string   If no datasource name is passed, use the complete service name to resync
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --broker string      Pub/sub service for events between services (default "grpc://:8030")
      --config string      Configuration storage URL. Supported schemes: etcd|file|grpc|mem|vault|vaults (default "file:///home/teamcity/.config/pydio/cells/pydio.json")
      --discovery string   Registry and pub/sub (default "grpc://:8030")
      --registry string    Registry used to contact services (default "grpc://:8030")
