Pluralize a string.

```
len $fish | plural "one anchovy" "many anchovies"
```

In the above, if the length of the string is 1, the first argument will be
printed (`one anchovy`). Otherwise, the second argument will be printed
(`many anchovies`).

The arguments are:

- singular string
- plural string
- length integer

NOTE: Sprig does not currently support languages with more complex pluralization
rules. And `0` is considered a plural because the English language treats it
as such (`zero anchovies`). The Sprig developers are working on a solution for
better internationalization.
