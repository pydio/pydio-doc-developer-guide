Welcome to the Cells v2 APIs and tooling references. 

## Audience

This is a good start if you wich to :

 * Programmatically interact with a Cells instance, for deployment automation, workflows, etc.
 * Learn more about the available Rest APIs and command line tools
 * Develop your own extensions to Cells
 * Fix bugs and submit pull requests to the project

For regular users, the Cells distribution comes in the form of precompiled binaries for Linux, MacOS X and Windows and there is no need to re-compile the code nor to understand the concepts that are presented in the current document.

## References

The current document is not exhaustive and the reader might also refer to other Pydio Cells documentation sources to get a complete understanding of the application, namely:

- The [admin guide](https://pydio.com/en/docs/cells/v1/installation-guides): this is a must-read to understand the application before starting to hack.
- The in-line documentation within the User Interface: we always try to have a self-explanatory and intuitive UI, with a lot of hints directly visible in the interface. Furthermore, a complete documentation of the REST APIs and services is accessible from the admin dashboard under All Plugins `>>` REST APIs. It is automatically generated with Swagger.
- [The code on Github](https://github.com/pydio/cells).
- [The on-line Go Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/pydio/cells).
- [The Pydio forum](https://forum.pydio.com) : if your question is not answered in any of the documentation, somebody might have asked it for you in the forum.
